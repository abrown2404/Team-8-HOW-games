<h3>February 21, 1986</h3>
<p> The first Legend of Zelda game is one of the most important games Nintendo has ever released. Series creator Shigeru Miyamoto credits the influence of the game to the caves and forests he explored in Kyoto as a child. 
As one of the first "open world" games, The Legend of Zelda captures that sense of exploration in a wide open world despite its technical limitations. 
Its openess was stated as one of the main influences on Breath of The Wild's creation, a game that revitalized the Open World Genre</p>
