<h3>Released on : March 20, 1997</h3>
<p> Symphony of the Night is one of 2 games that spawned the Metroidvania genre, games known for nonlinear, looping level design that, while still technically linear, gave players the first feelings of autonomy and open-endedness in video games. It sees Dracula's son, Alucard, exploring his castle in an effort to find him and defeat him once and for all, with a mind-melting twist that changed the way players saw game worlds forever. </p>
