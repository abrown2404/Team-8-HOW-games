<h3>Released on : June 23, 1996</h3>
<p> While it wasn't the first 3D game, Super Mario 64 might be the most influential. Instead of creating around 90 linear levels like previous 2D Mario games, Nintendo chose to craft 15 open air levels with objectives scattered throughout to encourage players to fully explore the space. Additionally, it contains various massive innovations, such as its groundbreaking camera, which set the standard for years to come. </p>
