<h3>Released on : March 19, 1994</h3>
<p> Super Metroid is one of 2 games that spawned the Metroidvania genre, games known for nonlinear, looping level design that, while still technically linear, gave players the first feelings of autonomy and open-endedness in video games. Set on planet Zebes, galactic bounty hunter Samus Aran sets out to retreive the baby metroid after it was stolen by the space pirate Ridley. </p>
