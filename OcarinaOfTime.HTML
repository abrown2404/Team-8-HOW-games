<h3>Released on : November 21st, 1998 </h3>
<p> Ocarina of Time, the 5th Zelda Game, revolutionzed the way 3D action games are made, and is considered one of the 
greatest games of all time. It features a for the time vast open world, where every area is connected in some way, mostly 
by areas branching off from the main hub area of Hyrule Field. The game's open world features iconic Zelda locations like 
Kokiri Forest, Kakariko Village, Death Mountain, and Zora's Domain. Overall, Ocarina of Time is one of the earliest examples 
of a 3-D game with an open world, and is still a cornerstone in the history of making an alive-feeling open world.
