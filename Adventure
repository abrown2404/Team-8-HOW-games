<h3>Released on : 1980</h3>
<p> Known as the first open world game, Adventure is a 1980 Atari game that saw the player explore a maze-like, open-ended environment to find the Enchanted Chalice and return it to the Golden Castle. It provided various other firsts in the gaming sphere, such as the first time enemies moved offscreen, one of the earliest examples of continuing your progress after dying, and the first major implementation of an “Easter Egg”. </p>
